CHIPPEWA,369,0,weird top sample
FRAINSLK,847,0,"check the top core age, check with Eric Grimm"
GREENLK,982,0,"Could add coretop by hand (based on Eric's email) - sampling date ""-22"" for 0cm - fine tuning is okay, 200 yr date should be removed altogether"
KIMBLE,13032,0,That depth seems wrong. All the radiocarbon dates are missing.
LILYLAKE,1633,0,Missing everything.
ANDRUSLK,205,0.5,"Simon thinks it's overfit, overconfident 210Pb dates likely a problem."
BIGJOHN,272,0.5,The deposition time seems too low at the bottom
CEDARBLK,352,0.5,underestimates then overestimates
CUB2,532,0.5,Missing the last rc date by 2kyr
HANSON,1004,0.5,"ugly plot, can't decide, missing last date?"
KELLHOL1,1447,0.5,"That seems right, just wonky. But this means the median is too low."
LAKEMARY,3473,0.5,"Seems to be missing a core top. Eric thinks the top sediments are missing.  Date assigned by COHMAP, probably a reasonable age, maybe nothing we can do about it."
LTDOLLAR,12001,0.5,"The Deposition time needs to be higher, acc mean should be higher."
MCNRNY2A,1725,0.5,"Presettlement assignment looks wonky, maybe our assesment of the pre-sett age is too old. (it's in a state forest, maybe make it younger)"
MCNRNY3A,3485,0.5,"Presettlement assignment looks wonky, maybe our assesment of the pre-sett age is too old. (it's in a state forest, maybe make it younger)"
MCNRNY4A,3486,0.5,"Presettlement assignment looks wonky, maybe our assesment of the pre-sett age is too old. (it's in a state forest, maybe make it younger)"
OTTOMLK,1840,0.5,"The model ignores pre-sett, the lead dates are wonked."
POGONIA,3558,0.5,"Seems to be missing a bunch of radiocarbon dates with the model, the memory might be too high? Is this a section problem?"
RYERSE,2318,0.5,"Flexibility problems at the bottom of the core, should be higher."
MENDOTAC,1735,0.75,"Probably should't be missing the date at 850cm, but otherwise okay."
MENDOTAD,3488,0.75,This is doing something crazy.  My guess is that the age at 75cm is wrong.
NELSLK,1793,0.75,"Giving us a >0 hiatus, pre-sett assignment might be too old."
REIDEL,2053,0.75,Except for the very bottom.
ROSSBURG,2290,0.75,"Having some problems with flexibility, that core top age is probably from a guess by Herb Wright."
STWDARK2,3781,0.75,"Missing the last date, but the last RC age seems young maybe (or the 2nd last seems high)"
WOLVERIN,3032,0.75,"There's lots I don't trust about the trace plot & posterior/prior for memory, but the model looks good."
